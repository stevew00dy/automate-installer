# üß™ AutoMate Installer Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What the Installer Does

The installer automatically:
1. **Checks system requirements** (RAM, disk space, OS)
2. **Detects missing dependencies** (Git, Node.js, Docker, Python)
3. **Offers to install missing tools** (via Homebrew on macOS)
4. **Validates API keys** (tests with actual API calls)
5. **Clones repositories** (AutoChat, AutoHub, AutoMem)
6. **Installs dependencies** (npm, pip, Docker images)
7. **Starts all services** (AutoChat, AutoHub, AutoMem, FalkorDB, Qdrant)
8. **Opens AutoChat** in browser

**Expected Time:** ~10 minutes on a fresh machine

## üñ•Ô∏è Testing on a Different Machine

### Best Test Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Fresh Mac** (RECOMMENDED)
- Clean macOS install (VM or fresh laptop)
- No developer tools installed
- Tests full installation flow

**Scenario 2: Partial Setup Mac**
- Has some tools (e.g., Node.js) but missing others (e.g., Docker)
- Tests selective installation

**Scenario 3: Your Current Mac** (SAFE)
- All tools already present
- Tests the "everything already installed" path
- Won't reinstall anything

---

## üìã What Gets Checked

### System Requirements:
- ‚úÖ **Operating System:** macOS 10.13+, Windows 10+, or Linux
- ‚úÖ **RAM:** 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Disk Space:** 5GB+ free
- ‚úÖ **Internet:** Required for downloads

### Required Dependencies:
- ‚úÖ **Git:** Version control (for cloning repos)
- ‚úÖ **Node.js:** v16+ (for AutoChat & AutoHub)
- ‚úÖ **Docker:** For FalkorDB & Qdrant databases
- ‚úÖ **Python:** 3.9+ (for AutoMem)

### API Keys:
- ‚úÖ **Anthropic API Key:** REQUIRED (powers Claude)
- ‚úÖ **OpenAI API Key:** OPTIONAL (for embeddings)

---

## üé¨ Testing Flow

### Step 1: System Check Screen
**What happens:**
- Installer checks for Git, Node, Docker, Python
- Shows ‚úÖ for installed, ‚ö†Ô∏è for missing

**If dependencies missing:**
- Shows "Install Missing Tools" button
- Clicking installs via Homebrew (macOS)
- Takes ~5-10 minutes depending on what's missing

**Expected behavior:**
- If all tools present ‚Üí "Continue" button enabled
- If tools missing ‚Üí "Install Missing Tools" button appears
- After install ‚Üí Rechecks system, then enables "Continue"

---

### Step 2: API Keys Screen
**What happens:**
- Asks for Anthropic API key (required)
- Asks for OpenAI API key (optional, can skip)

**Testing API keys:**
- Click "Test Key" button
- Makes actual API call to verify
- Shows ‚úì Valid or ‚úó Invalid

**Expected behavior:**
- Can proceed with just Anthropic key
- Can skip OpenAI key (uses free alternatives)
- "Install" button only enabled when Anthropic key provided

---

### Step 3: Installation Screen
**What happens:**
- Creates `~/AutoMate` directory
- Clones 3 repos from GitHub
- Installs npm/pip dependencies
- Starts Docker containers
- Launches services

**Progress indicators:**
- Shows current step (e.g., "Cloning AutoChat...")
- Progress bar increases (0% ‚Üí 100%)
- Completed steps show ‚úÖ

**Expected time:**
- ~2 min: Clone repos
- ~3-5 min: Install dependencies
- ~2-3 min: Start Docker & services
- **Total: ~10 minutes**

---

### Step 4: Success Screen
**What happens:**
- Shows all services running
- Lists URLs for AutoChat, AutoHub, AutoMem
- "Open AutoChat" button

**Expected behavior:**
- Clicking URLs opens browser
- Services are accessible
- AutoChat loads at localhost:3000

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Homebrew install requires password** - User needs to enter sudo password if Homebrew not installed
2. **Docker Desktop** - Must be running (installer doesn't auto-start it)
3. **AutoChat repo is private** - Will fail if not authenticated (need to fix this!)
4. **No rollback** - If installation fails partway, leaves partial install

### Issues to Fix:
- [ ] AutoChat repo should be public or handle auth
- [ ] Check if Docker Desktop is running (not just installed)
- [ ] Better error messages for specific failures
- [ ] Add "Retry" button if steps fail
- [ ] Add cleanup/uninstall option

---

## üß™ How to Test on Different Machine

### Option A: Using a VM (SAFEST)
```bash
# Create macOS VM (using UTM, Parallels, or VirtualBox)
# Download AutoMate Installer.app
# Double-click and test full flow
```

**Pros:**
- Clean slate
- Can test full installation
- Safe (VM is isolated)

**Cons:**
- Need VM software
- Takes time to set up

---

### Option B: Use a Friend's Mac (EASIEST)
```bash
# Send them: AutoMate-Installer.zip
# They: Unzip, double-click, follow prompts
# You: Watch over their shoulder (or screen share)
```

**Pros:**
- Real-world test
- See actual user experience
- Find UX issues

**Cons:**
- Need a willing friend
- Their machine gets AutoMate installed

---

### Option C: Fresh User Account on Your Mac
```bash
# System Preferences ‚Üí Users & Groups ‚Üí Add User
# Log in as new user (fresh home directory)
# Copy AutoMate Installer.app to new user's Desktop
# Test installation
```

**Pros:**
- Tests on your hardware
- Can delete user account after

**Cons:**
- Still shares system-level tools (Homebrew, Docker Desktop)
- Not a truly "fresh" system

---

### Option D: GitHub Actions / CI (BEST FOR AUTOMATION)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-installer.yml
# Run installer in GitHub Actions on fresh Ubuntu/macOS
```

**Pros:**
- Automated testing
- Truly fresh system every time
- Can test on multiple OSes

**Cons:**
- Need to set up CI workflow
- Limited interaction (can't see UI)

---

## üö® If Something Fails

### Error: "Git not found"
**Fix:** Installer should offer to install it
**Manual:** `brew install git`

### Error: "Docker not running"
**Fix:** Open Docker Desktop manually
**Future:** Installer should detect and prompt

### Error: "AutoChat clone failed"
**Fix:** Repo is private - need to make public or handle auth
**Workaround:** Clone manually with credentials

### Error: "Port already in use"
**Fix:** Stop conflicting services
**Check:** `lsof -i :3000` (AutoChat), `:3001` (AutoHub), `:8001` (AutoMem)

### Error: "npm install failed"
**Fix:** Check Node.js version (need 16+)
**Workaround:** `nvm install 18 && nvm use 18`

---

## üí° Recommended Testing Order

1. **Test on your machine first** (sanity check)
2. **Create a VM** (full flow test)
3. **Test on friend's machine** (real user test)
4. **Set up CI** (automated regression testing)

---
